# More on INVEST’s Partnerships

The wider aim of the program corresponds clearly with the long-term strategic aims of the Government of Afghanistan (GIRoA). The broad vision of the GIRoA’s Afghan National Development Strategy (ANDS) is to ensure that Afghanistan meets all of its Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2020. Within ANDS, INVEST-in-Kandahar supports Sector Four (Education): *Government's goal is to significantly improve the quality of, and promote equitable access to, education, skills development and other social services in order to re-invigorate Afghanistan's human capital, reduce poverty and facilitate economic growth.*

Mercy Corps will implement in partnership with relevant government ministries.  In alignment with GIRoA initiatives, the MoE is empowered to design and oversee formal TVET courses from grades 10 to 14, consisting of 2-3 year courses for students coming from secondary education. The MoE has recently established a national TVET steering committee that is tasked with driving the formalization of the TVET sector. Mercy Corps is represented on the Steering Committee and regularly contributes to strategic planning and research efforts alongside major donors, NGO partners (USAID, GIZ, JICA, UNESCO, etc.) and Ministry representatives.  While Mercy Corps will continue to support MoE’s efforts, it recognizes that the program is primarily aimed at providing shorter-term courses targeted to individuals who have had limited access to formal education. Delivery of these courses are currently the responsibility of the MoLSAMD and NSDP, and therefore Mercy Corps will work closely with these government departments, both centrally and provincially, to ensure that the curricula, student demographic and the nature of the courses remain closely aligned with the new government strategy for 2010 to 2015 and recently drafted TVET National Strategy and the National Education Strategic Plan (NESP II) for Afghanistan (2010-2014). In addition, Mercy Corps coordinates with the OCHA coordination group for humanitarian relief and IDP programs.

Jobs and entrepreneurship opportunities in Kandahar are secured through word of mouth from family, friends and direct contacts leaving IDPs and returnees at an acute disadvantage. INVEST-in-Kandahar will facilitate up to 48 (1 per-center, per-term) Ready to Work Clubs for targeted IDPs and returnees over the life of the project. Students will not be required to attend but based on Mercy Corps experience with the INVEST program the rate of participation will increase after the first cycle once they understand the value of the Clubs from peers. The Clubs will serve as a centralized structure for youth to explore their options related to both formal employment as well as entrepreneurship.

The format of the Clubs will vary based on the location, technical sector, and interests of the students however all the Clubs will build leadership skills, encourage peer-to-peer mentoring and emotional support, and support networking with the private sector. Sessions will include:

- *Entrepreneurship skills*: 
- *Leadership Skills*: 
- *Referrals and Linkages*: Clubs will build linkages between families of students and increase employee referrals across family lines and communities.

Clubs will be open to participation of graduates of short vocational training courses as well as skilled Afghan returnees and IDPs wanting to build their entrepreneurial capacity. In addition, clubs will be grouped by gender and age.
