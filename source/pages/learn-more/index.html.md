# INVEST in Kandahar

This proposed project seeks to address the key needs identified by IDPs by providing vocational training linked to economic opportunities within the locale and in the home provinces, by linking IDPs to relevant organizations providing literacy training and schooling and by delivering life skills modules to aid repatriation to home provinces. In June 2011, UNHCR and the World Bank completed research on IDPs in Kabul, Kandahar and Herat cities interviewing 450 IDP households (150 households per city). UNHCR found that conflict-induced displacement, limited reintegration opportunities for returning refugees, the rapid growth of cities, and the proliferation of informal settlements constitute an enormously complex challenge for the government, municipalities, and humanitarian and development actors in Afghanistan. Relevant highlights from the study include:

- While conflict and insecurity are usually the main push factors to displacement, economic considerations such as food security and better employment opportunities act as the main pull factors to the urban centers.
- Displacement to urban centers is rarely temporary. 70% of IDPs interviewed have lived in their current informal settlement for over two years and more than 90% plan to settle permanently. Eight percent said that their unwillingness to return home was due to the lack of livelihood opportunities in their place of origin. 
- IDPs living in informal settlements of urban areas tend to be more vulnerable and deprived than the non-IDP urban poor.
- IDPs have fewer labor market opportunities. This is mainly due to the lack of skills adapted to the economic context and lower literacy rate, which translates into lower earning capacity and higher vulnerability to poverty.

International and national groups deliver humanitarian assistance yet there is an acute demand for funding to shift towards economic recovery and direct livelihood opportunities for the returnee and IDP population. Afghan and international actors must go beyond a purely humanitarian approach and look for sustainable solutions for IDPs. Market-driven, short-term technical and life skills training linked to job placements â€“ that support existing Afghan government interventions - can address this demand.
