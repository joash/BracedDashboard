<p>The VTCs will deliver short courses (3 months, 2 hours x 6 days/week) for 7,500 students. Mercy Corps has learned from its work in Helmand that students that have limited experience with a classroom setting prefer classes that are of short duration, and practical and intensive. Mercy Corps recognizes the importance of providing education opportunities that are cognizant of the familial and financial obligations that constrain the majority of Afghan returnees. Graduates will be linked to the market and apprenticeships through their instructors drawn from the master craftsmen/successful business owners in the market (see Input 1.4). In addition, graduates and skilled IDPs and returnees will have the opportunity to participate in the Ready to Earn Clubs highlighted in Input 3.3. These clubs will serve to further build business oriented skills and connections to the market.</p>

<p>As demonstrated in the INVEST-in-Helmand program. Year 1 builds community trust and a positive reputation for the quality of the training and benefits of the program and allows for the expansion into female training centers. As Mercy Corps has found, once the value of the program and training is established then the community willingness to pay for the training goes up. Therefore, in Year 2 and Year 3 INVEST-in-Kandahar will introduce a model where students are asked to pay fees for the program to the VTCs. By the end of Year 3 the project will have a sustainable funding model for IDP and returnee VTC students in the VTCs. Given the very low incomes of the majority of residents, user-pay models are unlikely to be successful at the onset of the project, however, sustainability of the integration of returnees is crucial if they are to be an effective conduit to economic sustainability. INVEST-in-Kandahar aims to trial as many options as we can to achieve this.</p>

<p>Student recruitment will be done in partnership with entities in Kandahar that register IDPs and returnees. In addition, Mercy Corps Pakistan’s programming in Quetta has been working on vocational training with Afghan Refugees for many years and will act as a cross-border referral system for Afghan refugees seeking to become returnees to their provinces of origin in Kandahar and Helmand. Women and girls will be recruited through the Ministry of Women’s Affairs and UNHCR as soon as the level of prestige and trust for the program has achieved sufficient levels to facilitate community support for women’s vocational education.</p>
